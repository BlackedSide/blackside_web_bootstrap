    <div class="self-letter-para">
        <p>It's hard to say how much I love you. There has been a long time I didn't write a LOVE letter to you. These days I shocked myself to create this idea, to give you a surprise in 520.
            Having dinner or watching a movie is always the way we celebrate our festivals. In this time, we could not go to the cinema for enjoying a movie, so that it seems lacking a lot of fun
            between us. However, I suppose that the time being together, no matter what we are doing, is very wonderful time.</p>
        <p>I always afraid of my skill of programming could not earn enough money to give you happy life. But I believe that the way I program to create this kind of gift could bring you happiness.
            Thank you for always supporting me even though I always said that your suggestions are less helpful. However, listening to your suggestions makes me comfortable. I don't know what kind of
            career I would get in the future, but I will do my best to make our life much more comfortable. As well I hope that you will continue to support me whenever.</p>
        <p>Too much words would make me shy. Easy words to express my heart. I love you three thousand. Happy 520 and everyday in the future, both of us!</p>
